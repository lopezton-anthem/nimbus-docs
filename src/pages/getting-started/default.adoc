= Getting Started

== Building an Application with Nimbus
This guide provides a sampling of how Nimbus helps you accelerate and facilitate application development. As you read more Nimbus Getting Started guides, you will see more use cases for Nimbus. It is meant to give you a quick taste of Nimbus.

== What you’ll build
You’ll build a simple web application with Nimbus.

== What you’ll need

* About 10 minutes
* A favorite text editor or IDE
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK, window=_blank] 1.8 or later
* https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.2+, window=_blank]
* You can also import the code straight into your IDE:
** https://spring.io/guides/gs/sts[Spring Tool Suite (STS), window=_blank]
** https://spring.io/guides/gs/intellij-idea/[IntelliJ IDEA, window=_blank]

== How to complete this guide
Like most Nimbus Getting Started guides, you can start from scratch and complete each step or you can bypass basic setup steps that are already familiar to you. Either way, you end up with working code.

To **start from scratch**, move on to Build with Maven. **(COMING SOON!)**

To **skip the basics**, do the following:

* Download and unzip the source repository for this guide, or clone it using Git: `git clone https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-samples.git`
* cd into `nimbus-samples/nimbus-samples-web`

== Build with Maven
You can use any build system you like when building apps with Nimbus, but the code you need to work with Maven is included here.

After you execute `cd` into `nimbus-samples/nimbus-samples-web`, build with the following:
[source, bash]
----
$ mvn clean install
----

////
TODO - Replace contents below with "walk-through"
////

== Run the Application
Run the application by doing as follows:

[source, bash]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

You should see some output like this:
[source, bash]

Finally, load the application in your favorite web browser http://localhost:8080/nimbus-samples-web/login.
