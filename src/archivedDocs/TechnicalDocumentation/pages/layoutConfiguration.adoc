As you can see in the screenshot above, the layout of the application is
divided into 3 sections viz. Header, Footer, and Leftbar. Please read the code
below to understand the way the sections has been created.


[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Repo.java
----
public static class VPHome {

@Section(Type.HEADER)
private VSHomeHeader vsHomeHeader;

@Section(Type.LEFTBAR)
private VSHomeLeftBar vsHomeLeftBar;

@Section(Type.FOOTER)
private VSHomeFooter vsHomeFooter;

	}

NOTE: @Section(Type.*_value_*) determines the section on the page. This code shows
three of the _type_ values for @Section. For more values, please refer to the @Section
annotation within View Config Annotations.
