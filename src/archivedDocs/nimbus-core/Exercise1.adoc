==== Step 1
Run docker software

==== Step 2
* Run the command in terminal or use STS to clone the project: 

using ssh - ssh://git@bitbucket.anthem.com:7999/nim/petclinic-training.git

using http - https://<USEDID>@bitbucket.anthem.com/scm/nim/petclinic-training.git

Repo url - https://bitbucket.anthem.com/projects/NIM/repos/petclinic-training/browse

==== Step 3

Import the pet-clinic extension project into STS JavaEE perspective

==== Step 4

* Run maven build. Right click on project -> RunAs -> Maven build ->enter goals : clean install  and enable check box Skip Tests

This will download the configuration project for the complete pet-clinic app

This should create  a jar file in Users/<YOURUSERID>/Documents/clientextensions/com.anthem.nimbus.platform.client.extension.petclinic-1.0.0.M4-SNAPSHOT.jar
