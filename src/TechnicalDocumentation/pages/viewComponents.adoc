==== Tooltip
This is a new custom component that is added in the framework to provide additional information about all the input fields that are used within the
application. The input fields are the fields that require user selection like textbox, textarea, combobox, checkbox, input date etc.
In order to create a tooltip component for a particular field, all that is required is to add a help attribute in the field configuration.
Please look at the following example: -


[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Tooltip.java
----
@Radio(postEventOnChange = true, help="This field requires a value for pet type")
private String petType;
----

NOTE: The tooltip component will be created for this field and will display the specified value in the help field.
