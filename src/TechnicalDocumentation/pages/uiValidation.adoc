=== UI Validation

[discrete]
==== JSR Annotations
Support has been added for JSR 303 type annotations. All annotations inheriting from _javax.validation.Constraint_ will be picked up and
added to a configured parameter's configuration.

Specific support within the UI has been added for the following javax.validation annotations

.Supported Constraint Annotations
[cols="3,10", options="header"]
|=========================================================
| Name 				| Description

| @NotNull 			| Requires that a field should not have a null value.
| @Pattern			| Requires that a field follow a specific regex pattern.
| @Min				| Requires that a minimum value should be provided.
| @Max				| Requires that a maximum value should be provided.
| @Size				| Requires that a specific range should be provided. Useful for component groups.

|=========================================================

==== Static Validations
_Static validations_ are validations that will always be applied when rendered on the UI. All _javax.validation.constraints_ annotations 
are equipped with a _groups_ attribute of type _Class<? extends Payload>[]_. When _groups_ is empty (this is the default behavior), the 
framework treats the validation as a _static validation_.

[discrete]
==== Conditional Validations
_Conditional validations_ are validations that will only be applied on the UI when a particular condition has been met. An annotation from 
_javax.validation.constraints_ is understood as a _conditional validation_ when the _groups_ attribute is not empty.

_Conditional validations_ can be activated by the use of link:#validateconditional[@ValidateConditional].

IMPORTANT: If _groups_ has a non-empty array value, the validation will NOT be applied unless it is conditionally activated.

==== Special Considerations

.@Size
* When used in conjunction with **@CheckBoxGroup**, **@Size** will require the given number (_min_) of checkboxes to be selected or will limit the given number (_max_) of checkboxes that are able to be selected.

[discrete]
==== Custom Messages
The framework has the ability to pass custom validation messages from within JSR Annotations to the UI.


[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Repo.java
----
@NotNull(message = "First name should not be empty.")
private String status;
----

Here, if the UI field 'status' is left blank by the user, "First name should not be empty" message would be displayed. @NotNull will just display the default message.
