This part of the technical documentation will cover all of the core technologies used for building "configuration" 
using the Framework.

.What is Configuration?
_Configuration_ is a high-level term that is used to describe the code that ultimately drives the logic of the Framework. 
The topmost and most common type of configuration used will typically be found in the _domain model_.

While the domain model is typically responsible for being a holder of application's data, the Framework depends on it 
to also contain the aforementioned _configuration_ to provide instruction on how the Framework will execute certain 
defined events.
