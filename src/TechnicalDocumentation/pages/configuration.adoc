NOTE: This section of the documentation (Configuration) is a work in progress. Much of the details to be included here will consist of 
a general walkthrough of configuration abilities. Most of these abilities are already defined within the following sections under 
"Technical Documentation", but will be rewritten here to showcase a more logical flow of using the framework.
////
TODO Remove this NOTE once we get closer to completing this section of the documentation.
