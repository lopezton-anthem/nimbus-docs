.Framework has the ability to create an Audit Configuration for leaf parameters to generate audit history on state change of the annotated parameter.
When a leafParam is annotated with @Audit, based on the event handler defined for the annotation, the audit history is created for that particular leafParam.
By default, the @Audit functionality is invoked for OnStateChange event handlers.

Usage : @Audit(AuditHistory.class)

.VPCar.java
----
@Audit(SampleCarAuditEntry.class)
@Path
private String audit_String; // mapped and marked with Audit on both view & core

@Audit(SampleViewCarAuditEntry.class)
private String unmapped_String; // unmapped and marked with Audit on a quad with persistent core

@Path
private Integer audit_Integer; // mapped view to a core which is annotated with Audit

----
As you can see @Audit can be annotated on both view and core entities.
