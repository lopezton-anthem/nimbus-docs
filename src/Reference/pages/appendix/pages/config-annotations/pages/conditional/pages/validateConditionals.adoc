= ValidateConditionals

`@ValidateConditionals` is a collection of `@ValidateConditional` calls.

`@ValidateConditionals` should be used when multiple `@ValidateConditional` calls are needed to decorate a single param. See the following
example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.ValidateConditionals Sample 1
----
@ValidateConditionals({
	@ValidateConditional(when = "state == 'dog'", targetGroup = GROUP_1.class),
	@ValidateConditional(when = "state == 'cat'", targetGroup = GROUP_2.class)
})
@TextBox(postEventOnChange = true)
private String petType;

@NotNull
@TextBox
private String petName;

@NotNull(groups = { GROUP_1.class })
@TextBox
private String dogFood;

@NotNull(groups = { GROUP_2.class })
@TextBox
private String catFood;
----

We will examine two scenarios using Sample 1 above. One scenario where `petType` has the state `"dog"` and one where it has the state 
`"cat"`.

====
.ValidateConditionals Sample 1 - Results 1
The state of _petType_ is `"dog"`.

The params that have validations that will be applied are: `petName` and `dogFood`.

* `petName` - There are no groups associated with `petName`, hence it is seen as a _static validation_ and always applied.
* `dogFood` - `GROUP_1.class` is present within the `@NotNull`'s `groups` attribute, and this is matching `petType`'s 
`@ValidateConditional`'s `targetGroup` attribute(`GROUP_1.class`) and is applied.

The params that have validations that will not be applied are: `catFood`.

* `catFood` - While `catFood` has an entry in `@NotNull`'s `groups` attribute(`GROUP_2.class`), it is not matching `@ValidateConditional`'s 
`targetGroup` attribute(`GROUP_1.class`).
